### Step 2: Set Up Project Board (5 min)

   - In Progress
   - Review
   - Done

---

### Step 3: Organize Issues (2 min)

**Add to "Done" Column:**

## 📖 How to Use the Templates

Each template contains:

```markdown
## Sprint X: Title

### Tasks
#### 1. Main Task Name
- [ ] Subtask 1
- [ ] Subtask 2
- [ ] Subtask 3
- Acceptance Criteria: Clear definition of done

#### 2. Another Task
- [ ] Subtask A
- [ ] Subtask B
...
```

**As you work:**
1. Check off `[ ]` → `[x]` as you complete subtasks
2. GitHub automatically tracks progress (e.g., "5 of 15 completed")
3. Add comments with notes, screenshots, or links
4. Move between columns as you progress
